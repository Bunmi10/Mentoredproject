# Mentored Project
 
## Tasks
 
Here a Python application that is made up of 4 different services.
 
- Service 1 - Central App
- Service 2 - Provides random numbers
- Service 3 - Provides random letters
- Service 4 - Create an account number (Based on info from service 2&3) and gives a prize based on that account number.
 
You are tasked with deploying this application using all the skills you have developed throughout your time in the academy.
 
Your deployment should make use of,
 
- Docker/Docker-compose
- Ansible
- Jenkins
- Nexus
- SAST Testing
 
You should keep as many metrics as possible and write up reports on them in your README file. These metrics can include.
 
- Testing Coverage
- Deployment Success
- Build Logs
- Security Risks
 
## Stretch Goals
 
1. Use NGINX as a reverse proxy
2. Version Docker images
3. Include DAST Testing and Artefact Scanning
 
## Submission
 
You should create a Git repository that contains the code for the 4 services and any files you created to deploy your application including Dockerfiles, playbooks, reports etc.
You are also expected to make a README.md file and to fill this README with information of this challenge. It should contain the following headers.
 
## Why are we doing this?
The project is to showcase all my 4 weeks learning in the Academy and it was also a good way to practise all the tools that was delivered at the academy  
 
## How I expected the challenge to go.
 I was confident about the challenge as I have gotten better with my skills over the weeks compared to week one that I struggled with a task such as pushing to Git hub, I was able to push to Git hub without any assitance and I have a better understanding of the concept.
 
## What went well?
 The Sonaqube for the SAST testing was successful and I was able to incorporate all my learning at the academy into the project

## What didn't go as planned?
 I had some challenges with my VM over the course of the challenge there was intermitten network failure this slowed down the pace of work and I need to be mindful of syntax error such as spaces cap lock to mitigate issues with future projects
 
## Possible improvements for future challenges.
To keep learning and practising so I can get better at the concept/tools that have already learnt and any other concept/tools that will help me on my job
